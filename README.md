## Overview

Time tracking Dashboard is a front end mentor challenge that I decide to do to brush up on my grid and javascript skills.

### The challenge

Make a time tracking dashboard according to the specifications. Get info from a json file to fill the information.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## My process

Started developping the full size first then I moved on to the mobile version because it made more sense to me to do it that way.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned a little bit more about grid and how to place objects in a grid. I struggled with the javascript a bit because I was trying to find a way to loop through the Daily, Weekly and Monthly and show the json data according to the result of the click but I wasn't able to do it that way so I had to do 3 separate fetch calls instead of just one.

### Continued development

Definitely need more practice with grid and javascript.
